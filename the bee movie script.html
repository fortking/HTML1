		The site that I'd like to base my own off of is <u> <a href="https://www.2j-racing.com">2j-racing.com</a></u>.  2J is one that I look at every so often for modifications for my car. My model is featured on the front page! I like 2j because it's not too densely packed with text, or really any text aside from the main page, but still has a lot of information.
		I also like that the text is centered, and not mashed to the left.

		I'd like to think that my target audience is going to be memers on their mobile device. My layout is tailored to mobile. The only reasons you'd come to my site would be to:
		<ul>
		<li>Learn about the bee movie</li>
		<li>Learn about memeing about the bee movie</li>
		<li>Look at memes about the bee movie</li>
		<li>Have a laugh</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<!--And the Lord spake, saying, 'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin. Then shalt thou count to three, no more, no less. Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in My sight, shall snuff it.' :)-->
		The number of individual pages that I'd need would probably be 3. Here's the gist:
		<ul>
		<li>Main page, Introduces you to the Bee Movie, and probably some behind the scenes. I'd like to give some context for some of the good quotes/memes from the movie, such as "Ya like Jazz?"</li>
		<li>Page 2 will consist of the entire bee movie script, split across atleast 3 paragraphs. It'll probably be something similar to <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/bee-movie">Know your meme.</a></li> 
		<li>Page 3 will have a bunch of memes. Since this is tailored to memesters, memes are fundemental to the operation.</li>
		</ul>
